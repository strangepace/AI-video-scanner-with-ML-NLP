# Video Analysis System - Project Analysis

## 1. Architecture Approaches

### Successful Approaches
1. **Simple Frame-by-Frame Processing**
   - Direct processing of each frame
   - Good for small videos
   - Easy to debug and understand
   - Limitations: Memory usage, slow for large videos

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Processing frames in batches (BATCH_SIZE = 8)
   - Better GPU utilization
   - Reduced memory overhead
   - Good balance between speed and reliability

3. **Status Tracking**
   - ProcessingStatus class with memory stats
   - Progress tracking with ETA
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Helped identify bottlenecks

### Failed Approaches
1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Attempted multiprocessing for frame analysis
   - Issues: GPU memory conflicts
   - Race conditions in frame processing
   - Complex error handling

2. **Two-Pass System**
   - First pass: Quick scan for potential matches
   - Second pass: Detailed analysis
   - Too complex for real-time feedback
   - Memory usage doubled

## 2. ML Model Performance

### YOLO (Object Detection)
- **Successful Configuration**
  - YOLOv8m model
  - Confidence threshold: 0.35
  - Good balance of speed/accuracy
  - Works well with batch processing

- **Issues Encountered**
  - High memory usage with large batches
  - Need to clear CUDA cache regularly
  - Some false positives at lower thresholds

### CLIP (Semantic Matching)
- **Successful Setup**
  - Model: clip-vit-base-patch16
  - Similarity threshold: 0.25
  - Good semantic understanding

- **Challenges**
  - High memory usage when processing many crops
  - Needs careful batch size management
  - Processing time increases with object count

## 3. Backend Processing Strategies
